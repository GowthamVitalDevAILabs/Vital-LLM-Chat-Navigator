# VitalDev React Template Documentation Structure

This template follows the BMAD (Business, Mockup, Architecture, Development) method for documentation and development.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Business (B)
Location: `Docs/Business/`
Files to create:
- `requirements.md`: Business requirements and objectives
- `user_stories.md`: User stories and acceptance criteria
- `constraints.md`: Business constraints and limitations

### 2. Mockup (M)
Location: `Docs/Mockup/`
Files to create:
- `wireframes.md`: Low-fidelity wireframes (can link to Figma/other tools)
- `ui_components.md`: UI component specifications
- `user_flow.md`: User flow diagrams and interactions

### 3. Architecture (A)
Location: `Docs/Architecture/`
Files to create:
- `system_design.md`: High-level system architecture
- `data_model.md`: Data structures and relationships
- `api_specs.md`: API specifications and endpoints
- `tech_stack.md`: Technology stack details

### 4. Development (D)
Location: `Docs/Development/`
Files to create:
- `setup.md`: Development environment setup
- `coding_standards.md`: Coding conventions and standards
- `testing_strategy.md`: Testing approach and methodologies
- `deployment.md`: Deployment procedures and environments

## Template Usage Instructions

1. Create the documentation structure by following these steps:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p Docs/{Business,Mockup,Architecture,Development}
   ```

2. Copy the template files from this directory to their respective locations.

3. For each documentation file:
   - Replace placeholder content with project-specific information
   - Follow the provided structure in each template
   - Update links and references as needed

4. Keep documentation in sync with development:
   - Update relevant docs when making architectural changes
   - Maintain traceability between requirements and implementation
   - Document technical decisions and their rationale

## Integration Points

### Notion Integration
- Use Notion as the primary database during prototyping
- Store configuration in `.env` files
- Follow the setup guide in `Docs/Development/notion_setup.md`

### UI Components
- Built with shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS
- Follow component documentation in `Docs/Development/ui_components.md`
- Use the provided theme configuration

### Development Workflow
1. Start with Business documentation
2. Create mockups and get stakeholder approval
3. Design architecture based on approved mockups
4. Implement features following the development guidelines

Remember: This is a living template - adapt and evolve it based on project needs while maintaining the BMAD structure.
